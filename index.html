  Hello! My name is Viktana Cosplay, and I have currently been cosplaying for two years! I mostly cosplay from the newest Anime and Disney series! I plan to cosplay from movies, broadway shows, and many more things! A little bit about me is that i currently live in Louisiana, and plan to move to California for Film Studies the Fall of 2019! If you would like to know more about me or get to know me you can follow my Instagram @Viktana_Cosplay and make sure to leave a comment on what you think I should cosplay! I love you all very much, so my messages are always open, and my fabrics are always flowing!
